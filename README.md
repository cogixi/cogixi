Hi, Iâ€™m @cogixi. I am working in medical research (mostly as an innocent bystander), we are specifically looking at the effects of cognitive decline on older people and flowing from that, the effects on quality of life. We are all getting older, and if we can change the world for one person, we are better off.

In my spare time I'm really interested in web development. I am still learning. Learning is important each ane every day.
